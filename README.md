"Customer segmentation analysis for a travel agency using Python. Includes exploratory data analysis, clustering with K-Means++ and Agglomerative Clustering, and marketing strategy recommendations for identified customer segments."

# Customer Segmentation Analysis for a Travel Agency  

## Overview  
This project analyzes customer data for a travel agency to identify distinct customer segments. The goal is to help the agency optimize its marketing strategies by tailoring campaigns to different customer profiles.  

---

## Objectives  
1. Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset.  
2. Use clustering techniques (K-Means++ and Agglomerative Clustering) to segment customers.  
3. Interpret customer segments and propose targeted marketing strategies.

## Tools & Technologies  
- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, Scipy  
- **Clustering Techniques:** K-Means++, Agglomerative Clustering

## Project Workflow  

### 1. Introduction  
- Define the problem and the goal: To identify customer segments for optimizing marketing strategies.  
- Describe the dataset, including variables like age, gender, annual income, etc.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Performed summary statistics to understand the datasetâ€™s structure.  
- Visualized key variables using histograms, pie charts, and scatter plots.

### 3. Customer Segmentation  
- **Preprocessing:** Standardized numeric variables using `StandardScaler`.  
- **Optimal Clusters:** Determined the number of clusters using:
  - **Elbow Method**  
  - **Silhouette Plots**  
- **Clustering Techniques:**  
  - Applied K-Means++ and Agglomerative Clustering on all variables.  
  - Presented cluster centers and the number of customers in each cluster for both techniques.  
- **Cluster Interpretation:** Profiled clusters based on customer attributes.  

### 4. Recommendations  
- Suggested marketing strategies based on the K-Means++ results.  
- Examples: Tailored campaigns for high-income families, travel packages for young professionals, etc.

### 5. Conclusion  
- Summarized the analysis and insights gained.  
- Highlighted the benefits of segmentation for personalized marketing.
